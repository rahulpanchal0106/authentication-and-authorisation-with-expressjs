Authentication systems are a critical part of any web-app, especially when it comes to implementing features like the "delete user" functionality.

Authentication and Authorization play a vital role in maintaining a secure and well-structured system. Understanding the distinction between these concepts is essential for building reliable, robust and secure applications.

Here, Authentication means the process of verifying the identity of a user. It’s like checking someone’s ID at the door. In web apps, this typically includes verifying user names and passwords, tokens, or other credentials.

On the other hand, Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It’s like checking if the verified person has access to a restricted area. Authorization defines what resources or actions the user can access or perform.

### Difference
    - Authentication confirms who you are.
    - Authorization defines what you are allowed to do.

Although authentication is necessary to ensure that the applicant is who the user claims to be, it is not sufficient to check what access to unique features, (including deleting users) can be given to the user.

Key Point: Relying solely on authentication without considering authorization can lead to serious security risks, as it does not differentiate between different users' roles and privileges.

Implementing delete functionality after authentication, without considering authorization is a terrible idea. Imagine a scenario where every authenticated user, regardless of their role, can delete other users. This could lead to chaos and havoc (As a certain coffee-addicted CM would say) and potentially severe consequences, especially in environments where data integrity and user management are critical.

### Conclusion
So just relying on authentication to implement a delete user functionality is not enough. There should be a robust authorization system to ensure that only users with the appropriate privileges can perform such critical actions. While authentication verifies that a user is legitimate, authorization ensures that the user can only access or modify resources they are permitted to manage.
